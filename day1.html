      <h2>Day 1 | Regret</h2>
      <div>
        <h5>Guiding questions<br /></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>What are things that you regret you have done & haven't done?</li>
          <li>Why you did/didn't do it?</li>
          <li>How to materialize your regrets?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h5>Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        Regret is one of the most powerful emotions that I could think of. There is a common attitude towards regret that it would be a waste of time to think about these things afterwards, cause there’s nothing you can do to change what happened in
        the past. However, the more you hide it, the deeper it influences you. Spitting it out could actually help you to face the lost chances and gather more courage for the future.
        <br />
        I wonder what kind of things people would feel regret about, and what kind of stories these emotions are linked to. Time, location, counterparts, and the relationship itself, all could be cause one’s regret from many dimensions.

      <h5>Conceptualization</h5>
      <p>
        I did several interviews with my friends and also did some desktop research, and here’s what I got (I merged similar items and highlighted several items that I consider interesting): <br />

        <li>...</li>
      </ol>

      Words are untouchable and seems to raise less attention… it would be beautiful to materialize the regrets and put them into the scenario where it all (should) happens.

      <h5>TODO</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Find more physical objects that can be a container of people's regrets</li>
        <li>Put the objects into public spaces and observe passersby's reatcion with them</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Reflection</h5>
      <p>
        While doing the research, a lot of people say that they have nothing to regret about, which is a really positive attitude towards life. <br />
        According to Brain Wise, “The more opportunity you have, the more regret you'll feel”. So another positive thing about regret is that you’re having more opportunities to make your own decision and learn from it. <br />
        <strong>Which surprised me is that some people started to feel depressed after thinking about the question thoroughly, showing the great impact that regret can have on people.</strong>
