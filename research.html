      <h5>Concept Supplement</h5>

      <p>

        <span class="quote">"Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness.”
          <br>
          —— George Orwell
          <br>
        </span>
        <br>


        At the beginning of ideating this concept, my starting point was to develop some kind of metaphorical installation that helps people to understand the dark side of their emotions, like a ritual therapy that cures people from being hurt by
        their own feelings. I used to think that the less negative emotions you have, the happier you will be. But when I searched about “negative emotions” on YouTube, top results are mostly about how to deal with them, as if those emotions are
        something we’re trying to get rid of. So I started to think that, <strong>how do we give definition to “negative emotions”</strong>? is it something that makes us feel unhappy? What is the difference of being happy and living a good
        life? What if we
        just try to embrace and play with those “negative” emotions?
        <br>
        Then I realize that those emotions are only your unique way of reacting to the external world, there should be no positive nor negative about those feelings, but a process of receiving and giving feedback.
        <br>
        <strong>Even more, maybe we should even pursue the dark emotions in order to fully understand our own ways of sensing the surroundings</strong>......
        <br>
        Inspired by An’s question: “ Is it better to let people see through your true feelings? Is emotions our own treasure or just a tool to observe others? ”, a new question is raised: <strong>do we tend to hide just our negative emotions or also
          positive
          emotions? </strong>All of these have given me more motivation to learn about the dark emotion area.
        <br>
        Above are some further thoughts inspired by the research, which could work as a complement and extension.

        <h5>Research Report</h5>
        After the brainstorming, I decided to go with the 2nd concept -- the origin, form and results of a suspicious mind.
        <br>
        <span>Keywords: Derived from past experience | Self-protection | Affects the future </span>
        <br><br>

        <span class="highlight">Question 1: How to connect your past with your future </span>
        <br>
        Suspicion sits in between of the past and the future, it was born when the past starts to effect the future. The suspicious mind is like a microscope, enlarging all the capillaries and keep bifurcating tiny things.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Question 2: How to convey the idea of self-protection </span>
        <br>
        For this question, I wish to find more possible media to be the physical carrier of my idea. I listed noticeable feature of some interesting material to consider:

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Question 3: How to concretize the abstract relationship into touchable/visible matters </span>
        <br>
        For this question, I wish to find more possible media to be the physical carrier of my idea. I listed noticeable feature of some interesting material to consider:
