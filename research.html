      <h5>Concept Supplement</h5>

      <p>

        <span class="quote">"Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness.”
          <br>
          —— George Orwell
          <br>
        </span>
        <br>


        At the beginning of ideating this concept, my starting point was to develop some kind of metaphorical installation that helps people to understand the dark side of their emotions, like a ritual therapy that cures people from being hurt by
        their own feelings. I used to think that the less negative emotions you have, the happier you will be. But when I searched about “negative emotions” on YouTube, top results are mostly about how to deal with them, as if those emotions are
        something we’re trying to get rid of. So I started to think that, <strong>how do we give definition to “negative emotions”</strong>? is it something that makes us feel unhappy? What is the difference of being happy and living a good
        life? What if we
        just try to embrace and play with those “negative” emotions?
        <br>
        Then I realize that those emotions are only your unique way of reacting to the external world, there should be no positive nor negative about those feelings, but a process of receiving and giving feedback.
        <br>
        <strong>Even more, maybe we should even pursue the dark emotions in order to fully understand our own ways of sensing the surroundings</strong>......
        <br>
        Inspired by An’s question: “ Is it better to let people see through your true feelings? Is emotions our own treasure or just a tool to observe others? ”, a new question is raised: <strong>do we tend to hide just our negative emotions or also
          positive
          emotions? </strong>All of these have given me more motivation to learn about the dark emotion area.
        <br>
        Above are some further thoughts inspired by the research, which could work as a complement and extension.

        <br><br>
      <h5>Research Report</h5>
      After the brainstorming, I decided to go with the 2nd concept -- the origin, form and results of a suspicious mind. Suspicion sits in between of the past and the future, it was born when the past starts to effect the future. The suspicious mind
      is like a microscope, enlarging all the capillaries and keep bifurcating tiny things.

      <span class="highlight">Question 1: Behavioral characteristics of suspicion
      </span>
      <br>
      <em>
        In the majority of cases paranoia does not serve a defensive function, but instead builds on interpersonal concerns conscious to the person. (Daniel Freeman, Suspicious minds: The psychology of persecutory delusions)
        <br>
      </em>


      A suspicious mind is always ill-at-ease and spotting hidden meanings nobody else even considers are there. (wikiHow) It produces three behavioral characteristics: Magnifying, Minimizing, and Making-up.
      <br>
      Magnifying, is to exaggerate what happened, over-summarize, make a fuss about failure, and think that one failure all the time. For example, if a suspicious person text someone, and she/he doesn’t reply the person in a short time, this persons
      might start to think that “did I do something wrong that made he/she angry?”.

      <br>
      Minimizing, is only focusing on a very small part of the fact, on one’s own shortcomings or failings, and thus ignore most of his/her excellence and success. For example, if you’re suspicious and giving a lecture on the stage, 118 students out
      of 120 are listening carefully, the rest two of them are sleeping, you might consider your lecture as a failure cause it’s so boring that students are sleeping.

      <br>
      Making-up means to trump up reasons and results that does’t even make sense due to over association, to take an emotion out of nothing and think it’s the reality. There’s an awfulising thinking in this characteristic, that we tend to believe
      the bad results rather than the good results. This habit of thinking creates a tense and depressed atmosphere for people to live with.

        <span class="highlight">Question 2: How to convey the idea of self-protection </span>
        <br>

        The social level of suspicion is manifested as conspiracy theories. The study of conspiracy theory from the phycological perspective only started 10-15 years ago.There’s an interesting research from Rob Brotherton’s lecture <em>Suspicious
          Minds: The Social and Cognitive Psychology of Conspiracy Theories</em>:
        if you ask people if they think the Apollo program is fake, some people would believe it and
        others won’t; if you ask these people if they would like to
        participate in the fraud of faking this news, you’ll find that the group of people that is more willing to participate is <strong>the same group of people</strong> that is more likely to believe it’s a fraud. We only suspect other people will
        lie to us cause we would lie to others as well.<strong> “There’s a correlation between willingness to conspire and the belief in conspiracy theories”. </strong>According to the author of this study, this is a psychological tendency that we
        call <strong>projection</strong>.
        When we don’t have firm fact, we can just look in places other than the history book when we’re judging how plausible were or implausible what conspiracy is. When we look into ourselves and other people, we tend to project our own personal
        tendencies and beliefs onto other people. <strong>The person who would say yes to conspiracy theories tend to think the world is full of budding conspirators.</strong> <br>
        We use our suspicion as a protection, to avoid being exposed to others directly. I wish to continue with a metaphor of an object with many layers to represent the self-protecting function of suspicion. In 7 in 7, I used onion to convey this
        idea, the action of peeling the onion can be a good way to engage the audience into the interactive process. To enrich the meaning of the process, I wish to find other materials and media to replace the onion, but keep the movement of peeling
        it. It is also interesting to rewind the process of peeling, to use the action of building up a shell outside an original object inserted of taking the outside skin off. The material used to build the “skin” represents our personal experience
        that made us tend to protect ourselves. <strong>The “shell” grows thicker as our experience accumulates.</strong>

        <span class="highlight">Question 3: How to concretize the abstract relationship into touchable/visible matters </span>
        <br>
        The core of this question is to find the right metaphor and possible media to be the physical carrier of my idea. I’m satisfied with the metaphor of onion, as the peeling process shows a good analogy to understanding a suspicious mind with
        concise and powerful interaction.
