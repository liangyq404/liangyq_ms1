      <h2>7 in 7 Post Mortem</h2>
      <h5>Reflections</h5>
      <p>
        Echoing my motivation statement, I explored the “dark side of human nature” in the 7 in 7 projects. All 7 projects came from my personal experience and conversation with my friends. The first thing I want to confess is that the output is very
        incomplete and does not reflect my concept well. Some concepts may be too personal and lack a research basis. But I personally enjoyed the process of conceptualizing those ideas, cause this is the area I’d like to go further.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of concepts about emotion that I found are focused on bringing positive feelings, but what we shouldn’t do is try to avoid negative emotions as they might be uncomfortable to talk about. Those unspeakable things somehow can turn out to
        be really powerful in shaping our behaviors and causing chain reactions. I myself is very sensitive towards these kinds of “dark” feelings, and have been struggling a lot with them. So the process of brainstorming for 7 in 7 is like a process
        that I explored a therapy for myself. I indeed found metaphor turned out to be a great approach in this kind of topic, as it’s useful to materialize abstract emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among my 7 projects, my favorite one is <strong>the Guidebook of Getting Along With Onion</strong>. In my design process, interview plays a very important part, as my topics are rather private to talk about. During the conversation with a friend, we discussed
        the influence of suspicion on both the sender and the receiver. The conclusion came up obeying the common sense that the suspicious person always would be the one to blame. In fact, their motivation is never to hurt others but to protect
        themselves from being naive and careless. They have trust issues mostly from previous unpleasant experiences. However, they are always being blamed cause their thought activity and the related behavior (mostly over-thinking and having
        comments based on their wrong inference) seem to be aggressive. The outcome was divide into two parts: 3 rules and a video clip. The 3 rules of getting along with onion reflect on the conclusions I mentioned above and aims at awakening
        people’s speculative thinking about the misunderstanding towards suspicion. And the video shows the process of peeling an onion, which is the metaphor that I chose of “how to get along with onion”. Onion is difficult to peel, and you could
        end up crying cause of the smell, which is similar to the feeling of getting along with a suspicious friend that hides his/her true feelings so deep just stay away from being hurt but also involuntarily hurting others. I should redo the video
        to show more interaction between the person and the onion, such as the person struggling to find the heart of the onion but failed many times cause there are too many layers, also the person tearing cause of the smell of the onion and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I mentioned in the reflection of <strong>50 Things to Regret</strong>, during the research process, some interviewees started to feel depressed after thinking about the question thoroughly, showing the great impact that regret can have on
        people. On the
        one hand, this power is the thing I want to visualize and present to the audience, but on the other hand, I’m a bit concerned that this kind of topic might not be easy to dig into cause people sometimes resist facing this negative power. So
        the important thing here is how to break down the pressure and convey them into reflective “blocks” that are more acceptable and comprehensible. It is important to balance the pressure of reflection and the motivation it triggers if the
        outcome is about to be put in public.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Candy for Jealousy</strong> also has some positive responses. This project was to provide people with a method to deal with jealousy. We’re likely to consider the solution to being jealous is to spit it out and face it directly,
        but we’re
        neglecting the fact that jealousy also has the feature of being one-sided. For example, if you knew that the person you’re jealous of is also jealous of you, you would actually feel relief and the negative effect of jealousy would decrease.
        It is also helpful when someone you trust tells you that you have something that other people could be jealous of. The idea of the candy jar came from the concept of the fortune cookie, where people find random inspiring words on the note.
        Though the note is not actually related to your current concern, sometimes it could be surprisingly comforting. Candy also represents “sweet things”, which is exactly what I want to convey with this project. As Han mentioned in her comment,
        healing design is also one way I can work with. Winnie’s advice for this project is very inspiring, as she mentioned: “…how the audience interacts with the jam without telling them what it is for.” I think this can be applied to other
        projects as well since sometimes it would be interesting to see people’s unconscious reaction, which is more intuitive and brings more randomness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Over association</strong> is one of the topics that I feel most deeply. From my personal perspective, the comment that I often receive from others is “you’re overthinking”. Whether it is derogatory or not, this kind of comment will
        invisibly increase
        my mental pressure. The output of this project is intended to help people realize which jump steps they have gone through in the process of excessive association. After visualizing our own thinking clues, it helps us to reflect on ourselves.
        Which links have wrong connections, and trace the sources of these wrong connections, and find out where these connections are related to our previous experience. In the photo I came up with, the green stickers show the normal thinking route
        and the pink stickers show the jumpy thinking route. For further development, I wish to invite people to participate in the process of collecting the evidence of over association.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Comfort Zone</strong> is related to what we’ve been talking about for the whole semester - data privacy. But in this case, the camera set beside the table is like a representation of the witness, referring to “the eye of the table”.
        However, the ideal
        situation is that the table produces a record of a unique form that can only be produced by a table instead of a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Obedient forgetting</strong> comes from my anger at obliterating memories and expresses my resistance. This band that I like very much used to exist, was loved or disliked, and once had its own audience, but now it is because I have
        no way to know The
        reason was erased. History has no truth, we will only remember what they want us to remember.
      </p>

      <h5>Future Steps</h5>

      <p>
        Overall, 7 in 7 helped me sort out my thoughts and process of finding the concept I want to conceptualize. Among them, the 1/3/4/5/6 projects are something I think can be further developed. How to transform the concept into a physical device
        is what I need to focus next.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the improvement, I hope I can come up with more concrete ideas about the prototypes. As Professor Fan pointed out, that my current prototype has very little interaction with the audience. I feel strong resonance from the comments by the
        class, which is really good feedback cause I was worried that people would not have so much in common towards their emotions. So I think inviting the audience to participate and collect their results of interacting with the installation as a
        final output could be a good way to enrich the whole experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next stage, just like the feedback I got, I wish to try to merge my concepts with different kinds of media and think more about how to turn the more personal outcomes into something that can be exhibited in public and collect actual
        feedback from the audience. As for the prototype, I’m looking for forms that are more flexible and do not rely on screens. There is some kind of material that I want to play with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sand seems to be the first one I want to try out. In my
        undergraduate, I tried to use sand to carry out the idea of memory & smell. It turned out that sand has a special effect as it is actually a good carrier of smell. It is also very playful to interact with, as we all have the memory of playing
        sand in our childhood. The sound of stirring the sand is also very healing, bringing a sense of comfort to the player. I wish to correlate the touch, smell, sound of sand with inner feelings, and deliver a delicate emotion by this material. Candle is also an interesting media to work with as it is easy to shape and has a texture between liquid and solid.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal concern is that with such high-intensity advancement, the output of the project will be relatively sloppy. Since I have not conducted a very in-depth research on the topics I have selected, I hope that I will have more time to
        select a selection To conduct more in-depth and extensive research on the subject, and have the opportunity to try different types of prototypes to test which prototype is more suitable for such projects.
