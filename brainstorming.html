      <h2>Final Project Concepts Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>
        This is a group-work with <a href="https://ankongkk.wixsite.com/design/5-concepts">An</a>, <a href="https://jinxinli01.github.io/jinxinli01/1/">April</a>, <a href="https://yibo-fu.github.io/MS1-Portfolio/brainstorm.html">Yibo</a>, <a
          href="https://www.zijiachen.com/ms1/10.html">Ace</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Final-Project-Concepts-cbbfbb85dca541fc8e88752c4d9ae143">Sarita</a> and <a href="https://bihanli-majorstudio1.glitch.me/5projects.html">Bihan</a>.
        <br>
        For the final concept, I continued with the topic from my 7 in 7 and enriched it a little bit. Check the Miro board below to see the brainstorming process‚Ä¶followed with elaborations about my top choices :)
        <br>
        The core theme I chose for the final project is ‚Äúthe unspeakable emotions‚Äù. In 7 in 7, I selected specific emotions to begin with. For the final concept, I wish to cut in from other aspects as well, and push the ideas from several different
        sides. As emotion is a really abstract topic to work with, I wish to continue the method of <strong>materializing it into tangible objects</strong>, which I believe could bring the audience more intuitive feelings and thinking.

      <h5>Concept 1: the unspeakable adjective</h5>
      <p>
        To work with topics around dark emotions, I think it‚Äôs important to balance what people feel strongly inside and what people are willing to share with others. No matter it is jealousy, suspicion, or the desire to control, we tend to hide
        these feelings as it‚Äôs <strong>not comfortable</strong> to say them out aloud frankly whether it‚Äôs to yourself or to others.
        <br>
        What you say is not always what you feel, and sometimes there are two sides about the same feeling. For example, when you feel jealous towards someone, you might not say frankly that you‚Äôre jealous, instead, you might say that you admire the
        person, or you might not even admit that you‚Äôre jealous.
        <strong>It is interesting to think about how these emotions are expressed differently to others and to yourself.</strong>
        Outwards emotions tend to be a social function, as we use it to communicate. A
        lot of the time what we express to others might not be our true feelings, we do it for the sake of communication. We feel, we find a way that is accepted by the public opinion and then we express it. But for inwards emotions, can you be
        honesty to yourself? <strong>Have you noticed how many steps you have taken before you finally give definition to ‚Äúhow do you feel now‚Äù?</strong>
        <br>
        So, I think it might be a promising direction to focus on the two sides of emotions, and explore more about <strong>how people lie about their feelings, no matter in purpose or unintentional</strong>.

        Feedback for further development:
      <ol>
        <li>Collect more examples to see if there‚Äôs obvious convergence in this area</li>
        <li>Get inspired from behavioral economics. In the field of economics, studies are more frank towards the dark side of humanity, such as jealousy, they even have equations to calculate it. The material Bihan gave me was super helpful and
          inspiring. </li>

        <h5>Concept 2: the unspeakable past</h5>
        <p>
          Among the seven projects I developed last week, my personal favorite one is the theme suspicion. For me, suspicion is usually caused by previous experiences, similar to the post-traumatic stress disorder, but not as severe. Our history
          shapes us in many ways. There are cases that something happened only once but deeply affected us, more circumstances are things that happen over and over again affect us subtly. Tracing back to ‚Äúthe first strike‚Äù sometime can help us to
          understand why we feel and behave the way we do, not only as a direct cause but also a hidden influence. Sometimes it hides so deep that we can‚Äôt articulate it clearly, what we finally become could be so different from what we originally
          were. Also, <strong>people tend to hide their past intentionally cause they just want to burry their unspeakable past</strong>.
          <br>
          A brief idea of the outcome is a process of packing an object with tin foil and put other materials inside each layer while doing it. This was inspired by the onion project, and the process of peeling it off appears to be very ritual. The
          final look of the object might be nothing similar to the object itself, but relates more to the ‚Äúingredients‚Äù we added. I also think that it would be interesting to show the documentary video in a rewind way, to surprise the audience with
          how much the object has changed due to many layers of small influences, which is exactly where the suspicious mind was born.

          <h5>Concept 3: who decides?</h5>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve been trying to interpret the emotions from the psychological perspective, one thing Sarita mentioned in the class brainstorming was the biological reason of why these dark feelings emerge.
            <br><br>
            <em>"Emotions are biological states associated with the nervous system brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. There is currently
              no scientific consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity, and motivation." (WIKIPEDIA)
            </em>
            <br><br>
            But is there anything more than the physiological explanation? Is the stimulation from the external world and the reaction inside our body simply connected by scientific links? <strong>What is the greater power?</strong>
