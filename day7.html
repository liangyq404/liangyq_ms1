      <h2>Day 7 | Desire to Control</h2>
      <div>
        <h5>Guiding questions<br /></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>What are we talking about when we talk about perfectionism? </li>
          <li>Is control one-sided or two-sided? </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h5>Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        Many people are faced with the anxiety caused by perfectionism. This anxiety actually comes from the inability to make ourselves and people around us to exist in the way we want. <strong>The desire to control others is closely related to
          domination, self-validation, narcissistic deprivation, instrumental anger and negative selves.</strong> Failing to develop a correct attitude towards the power of control can cause long-term mental distress, thus it is critical to find the
        balance between the two parties involved in a controlling relationship.
      <h5>Conceptualization</h5>
      <p>
        A very interesting phenomenon I found is that <strong>people who show strong desire to control others sometimes secretly desire to be controlled as well.</strong> So it occurred to me that <strong>maybe the only way to create balance between
          the two parties is to make them control each other.</strong><br>
        üëáThis is a film of the performance ‚ÄúRest Energy‚Äù by Abramovic and Ulay in 1980.<br>

        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/358726469" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

        <span style="color:#9e9e9e; font-size:13px;"><em><a href="https://vimeo.com/358726469">Marina Abramoviƒá &amp; Ulay &ndash; Rest Energy, 1980</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/keithwhittle">Keith Whittle</a> on <a
              href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</em><br><br></span>

        In this performance, if Ulay loose the arrow, Abramovic will fall, and then Ulay will fall as well cause the power that holds him standing is lost. <strong>I found it shows a strong sense of ‚Äúcontrolling each other‚Äù, they set pressure n each
          other and in the meantime, they live for each other. </strong><br>
        For this project, I wish to create a pair of physicalized tool that can restrict each other.
      </p>

      <h5>Prototype & Outcome</h5>
      <p>
        The process of using this tool will be shown in three parts:
      <ol>
        <li> Side A controls side B, the result is not ideal</li>
        <li>Side B controls side A, the result is not ideal</li>
        <li>Side A and side B controls each other, it works out fine </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h5>Reflection</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Control is not one-sided, but affects both sides.</strong> I strongly feel that when the engaged two sides are me and my life, it perfectly make sense cause I‚Äôm struggling to control my life while my life also sets endless limits to
        me. <br>
        This is like the darkest project of the ‚Äú7 in 7‚Äù. These 7 rough projects all came from the ‚Äúnot-so-positive‚Äù emotions that I feel every day. They are abstract and difficult to deal with, but through the process of physicalizing it, I kinda
        have grown to understand the roles that these emotions play in my life, I have even found some tips to ease the negative impacts that these emotions had brought.
