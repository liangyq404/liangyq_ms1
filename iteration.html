      <h2>Iteration</h2>
      <h5>Feedback from 1 on 1 meeting with Professor Fan</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The most important thing of modern art is the process rather than the final result. Focusing more on the peeling behavior itself could bring emotions to the audience. Use the engaging process to enrich the audience’s experience. The whole
          process could be the biggest meaning of the project. </li>
        <li>Start with specific topics instead of abstract emotions. </li>
        <li>The peeling process could also be a kind of interface that goes from outside to inside. </li>
        <li>The trigger to the interaction is important</li>
        <li>What is the core? It could be what you didn’t expect from the outside, or it could be nothing at all. </li>
        <li>How to build a seductive interface and attract viewers to interact</li>
        <li>Art doesn’t need to be educational.</li>
        <li>Peeling could also be a form of timeline.</li>
        <li>Select and reform media that people are familiar with. </li>
        <li>Food design. To peel a virtual space. </li>
        <li>Use transparency to represent the multi-layers constructer </li>
        <li>Scent that transforms with heat.</li>
        <li>What are the structures that could be peeled? To observe life more carefully</li>
        <li>Synthesis of process materials.</li>
        <li>Art Archaeology, to discover within the process of exploring.</li>
        <li>How to build the sequence & system.</li>
        <li>It could also be a way of narrative, and it changes when the audience gets involved. </li>

      </ul>



      <h5>Iteration 1.0</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Something I wish to stick to:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The purpose to show the assistance of the social pressure on hidden emotions </li>
        <li>The object has some hints that attract the audience’s attention and Like exposing part of the inner layer to suggest that it can be peeled. </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Something I wish to change:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Instead of creating a small multi-layer object that only allows one audience to hold it and peel it, why not create a large one that hangs in the middle of an exhibition room and allows multi audience to interact with it at the same
          time, while <strong>each audience can have a unique result</strong> of how much they wanna peel it and how many layers they wanna explore. </li>
        <li>Use stethoscopes to <strong>amplify the peeling sound</strong>. Enriching the multi-sensory immersive experience. The audience can hear the sound of the material when they do it. It could be a fake stethoscope that connects to the
          pre-edited sound file.
        </li>
        <li>Emotion is not what I would put forward directly at the beginning of the experience, but let the audience to feel it <strong>in the process of peeling</strong>, with the trigger of luring them to continue and the auditory feedback. </li>
      </ul>
