      <h2>Final Personal Statement</h2>

      <p>
        For me, <strong>the emotional reaction that a design can cause is the most important part of the interaction journey, as emotion is the main takeaway part after the interaction flow which could last really long.</strong> Based on my person experience, I found design could be hypocritical sometimes, as designers are having a bias on emotion that they only want the “positive” ones. This motives me to explore more about those emotions that we’re not comfortable, or not allowed to talk about.
        <br>
        Working with “the unspeakable emotions” is a whole new experience for me, as it’s also a process of exploring myself, my interest area and my own way to express feelings. Here, “unspeakable emotions” has two meaning, one is for those strong emotions we have but rather not to speak about, the other one is for those fuzzy, blur emotions we ourselves are not clear about. The research process about people’s unspeakable emotions required many times of “narrowing down” to a specific scenario (which I didn’t fully succeed this time and hope to interact in the future). Then I realized that I shouldn’t start from emotions, but to end with emotions. <strong>It is important to be clear about where the emotions come from as it’s always triggered for a reason, and what is the most instinctive metaphor</strong>.
        <br>
        Testing the prototype played a very important role in my design process, as my design aims at the audience’s resonation. Emotion is such an abstract and subjective topic, that it’s difficult to contextualize. By searching for reference, I found it very important for me to get inspired from performance art and psychological studies. <strong>The smooth connection between each step of the interaction highly depends on how the logic behind the scene is presented to the audience</strong>. If the logic is not powerful enough, it is also difficult for the audience to catch up with different steps the interaction process. Also, finding people who’s unfamiliar with the project to do the test appears to be significant cause that’s the only way to test whether natural instinct is working well in this project.
        <br>
        From my prospective, my final outcome of Major studio 1 is more like an art piece than a design work, cause I mostly started from my personal experience and expanded to people who feels the same way. So I want to consider <strong>how to give a more solid background to my design to make it more reasonable to a larger audience</strong>. This requires more research both from the society and the individuals.
        <br>
        Guided by the question “what happens before/during/after the experience”, I divided my experience flow into three parts:
        <ol>
          <li>The object has some feature that attracts the audience and invites the audience to interact/ The audience get triggered by the object to start the interaction</li>
          <li>The audience feels the emotion being evoked during the interactive process</li>
          <li>The audience finished the process and leave </li>
        </ol>
        As the current installation can be interacted with for only once, one thing I need to push further is what will happen after the interaction is done. The camera inside is supposed to give the sense of eye contact and questioning, but it appears to be too “zoomed out” for the audience to feel this purpose. One direction is to think about how to store the emotion after it’s been evoked. Another direction is about how can the audience get more direct feedback from the interaction flow instead of just a shocking moment and fuzzy feelings. The direct feedback should be something that has meaning to the audience. The output of the object is also a new input to the audience.
        <br>
        The feedback I collected from the class mentioned about several things that I should keep in mind:
        <ol>
        <li>Design doesn’t to be didactic, but to help people. In my case, the object does’t need to teach people about how to deal with your/others’ emotions, but to help people find their own way of knowing their emotion better </li>
        <li>Sometimes the process is more important than the result (how to make the process more powerful)</li>
        </ol>
        In the following semesters, I wish to continue exploring how to materializes abstract concepts into sensible forms, using touchable materials as well as scent and sound. There’s a more subtle emotional reaction when interacting with senses other than just visual. To carry on with my principle of designing for the post-screen era, bringing the multi-sensory approach to my design is essential as it enriches the audience’s experience and triggers more layers of interaction.
