    <h1>Welcome! I'm Liaaaaa :)</h1>
    <p>
        Hi there! This is my portfolio page for Major Studio 1.
    </p>

  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi there! This is Yuqing Liang, a dog lover and a movie fan.  üêï üé¨ <br/>
  I graduated from the School of Design, Jiangnan University in summer 2020, and I majored in product design.<br/>
   During 2018 I exchanged in the Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK) in Finland for one semester. <br/>
   Currently I‚Äôm in my first year of graduate study at Parsons, Design and Technology.

  <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
   <p >
     In my undergraduate, we mostly worked with user-centered design topics, such as designing for the elderly and the kids, how to improve the user experience for existing design like service design. So basically I focused on solving problems for more than 3 years, but I gradually realized that this kind of design is not what we need the most anymore, cause it sometimes cause laziness not only behavioral, but also ideological. <strong>It‚Äôs slightly different between providing the user with a better life and an easier life, and there are some issues that cannot be solved by a simple ‚Äúsolution‚Äù.</strong>
<br/>
    I don‚Äôt like the feeling of being analyzed, that one day the product I use might know me better than I do, cause the designers have analyzed me so well. I feel it‚Äôs like an invisible controller. So I started to think about <strong>why do I follow the rules and how can I stay in control of myself.</strong> The book Speculative Everything is like one of my enlightenments, where I learned that sometimes it‚Äôs more important to ask the right question than to give the right answer.
<br/>
    For Major Studio 1, I wish to develop something that can be put into public space and actually interact with the passersby, not only those who are interested in design but also those who are not familiar with it. I wish to communicate with the audience‚Äôs <strong>intuition and instinct</strong>. I wish to discover their conditioned reflex, and direct response from their consciousness.
    <br/>
    <strong>The five senses is also a direction I want to work with.</strong> Back in 2017, the first Design for Transition: International Conference was held by JNU, during which I was deeply inspired by Dr. Nick Bryan-Kinns‚Äôs lecture about the ‚Äúpost-screen era‚Äù. The lecture showed us a series of experiment with sound and tactile, creating playful interaction between the audience and the designed object. Though it was still at a prototyping stage, the interaction was surprisingly natural and leads to various of emotional resonances. As electronic devices have occupied every corner of the world, the screen becomes a parasite, and it invades our lives through our vision and sometimes hearing. We have neglected the other three senses that we‚Äôre born with: tactile, taste and smell. It is our natural habit to use all these five senses during the process of acknowledging the world. Thus, I believe that it is important to balance the five in order to rebuilt the lost connection between our body and the surroundings.
