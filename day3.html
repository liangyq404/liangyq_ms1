        <h5>Guiding questions<br /></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>How do we process with the unspeakable emotions?</li>
          <li>The “masks” of our unspeakable emotions </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h5>Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        A friend of mine once said, “I use to be jealous of others too, but then I found that others could be jealous of me, cause I also have things that they don’t have. Then I don’t feel the pressure of jealousy anymore.”
      </p>
      <h5>Conceptualization</h5>
      <img class="embed" src="assets/noteOftheDay.JPG" alt="noteOftheDay">
      Jealousy is a two-sided emotion. It can give us great pressure, but it can also be our motivation. The interesting question is: <strong>how to make it a less serious question and relate it to more positive attitude?</strong>

      <p>
        On the left is a “Bible of the day” I got from a cathedral in Prague. I’m especially impressed by the sentence “do not let sun set on your anger”, and realized that such <strong>short sentences can actually have great power of inspiring
          people.</strong><br>
        I wish to create a candy(or other snacks if the friend doesn't like candy) box where candies are packed by paper with notes. It could be a gift to someone, and all the notes will be written by his/her friends, of nice things about this
        person. When this person feel jealous, he/she could take
        a candy and read about positive comments about himself/herself, reminding him/her that he/she doesn’t have to be jealous of other people.<br>
        <strong>After all, "Sweet things" always make people happy... </strong> (●°u°●) 
      </p>


      <h5>Prototype & Outcome</h5>


      <h5>TODO</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>By some candy and write nice words about a friend on the package, ask other friends to participate</li>
        <li>Put the candy in a gift box and give it to the person </li>
        <li>Maybe...ask the friend to record whether the candy and notes can help dealing with jealousy</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Reflection</h5>
      <p>
        It actually makes people feel better when getting approbation from others. I hope through this project people can grow to be more confident about themselves, and also encourages friends to express nice feelings towards each other more often.
