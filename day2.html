        <h5>Guiding questions<br /></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>What and why do THEY want you to forget? </li>
          <li>Where can we find the disappeared history and how can we memorize it</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h5>Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        <img src="assets/Warlounge.png" alt="Warlounge">
        Recently I found two songs that I really like on a music platform. When I was trying to find the singerâ€™s other work, I realized that they were disbanded, and their work was somehow all deleted except for these two. I was curious about what
        happened and tried to search for the band on google, however there was no information I could find about the reason why they went almost invisible or why their songs were deleted from the internet.<br />
        The first two results of google when I searched for the name of the band is: how to evaluate this band. And the comments went pretty extreme, some people look down on this band very much while others give good rating to it. It was actually
        annoying that I can only put together pieces of information from comments on the Internet. There are also others bands/singer disappeared from the public view for some reason which is not so public.<br />



      </p>
      <h5>Conceptualization</h5>
      <p>
        I wish to create an archive for these artists and try to track the reason behind their missing, mostly through the comments. The ideal outcome will look like a trail map.

        <li></li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Reflection</h5>
      <p>
        The only resistance we can do is not to forget.
