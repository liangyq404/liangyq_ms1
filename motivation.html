      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        In my undergraduate, we mostly worked with user-centered design topics, such as designing for the elderly and the kids, how to improve the user experience for existing design like service design. So basically I focused on solving problems for
        more than 3 years, but I gradually realized that this kind of design is not what we need the most anymore, cause it sometimes cause laziness not only behavioral, but also ideological. Design is a tool, and shall remain to be a tool.
        <strong>For me design itself shouldn’t be the result, but part of the process of achieving a goal. It’s slightly different between providing the user with a better life and an easier life, and there are some issues that cannot be solved by a
          simple “solution”.</strong> In terms of living a better life, design not only helps in physical area, but also in mental aspects.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t like the feeling of being analyzed, that one day the product I use might know me better than I do, cause the designers have analyzed me so well. I feel it’s like an invisible controller. So I started to think about why do I
        follow the rules and how can I stay in control of myself. The book Speculative Everything is like one of my enlightenments, where I learned that <strong>sometimes it’s more important to ask the right question than to give the right
          answer.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For Major Studio 1, I wish to develop something that can be put into public space and actually interact with the passersby, not only those who are interested in design but also those who are not familiar with it. I wish to communicate with
        the
        audience’s <strong>intuition and instinct</strong>. I wish to discover their conditioned reflex, and direct response from their consciousness. Instead of the common emotions we talk about everyday, such as feeling happy, sad or anxious,
        <strong>it is often the darker side of human nature that we need think about in order to understand the way we function</strong>. I want to focus on those emotions that we do not usually talk abut fair and honest, like jealousy, regret and
        suspicion.
        These kind of emotions are so powerful, that they can shape one’s thoughts, and give deep explanations towards people’s behaviors. <strong>We shall embrace our dark sides. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The five senses is also a direction I want to work with, it is also a suitable form for interactive installations. </strong> Back in 2017, the first Design for Transition: International Conference was held by JNU, during which I was
        deeply inspired by Dr. Nick Bryan-Kinns’s lecture about
        <strong>the “post-screen era”</strong>. The lecture showed us a series of experiment with sound and tactile, creating playful interaction between the audience and the designed object. Though it was still at a prototyping stage, the
        interaction was surprisingly natural and leads to various of emotional resonances. As electronic devices have occupied every corner of the world, the screen becomes a parasite, and it invades our lives through our vision and sometimes
        hearing. We have neglected the other three senses that we’re born with: tactile, taste and smell. It is our natural habit to use all these five senses during the process of acknowledging the world. Thus, I believe that it is important to
        balance the five in order to rebuilt the lost connection between our body and the surroundings.
